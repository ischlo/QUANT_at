# CASA_quant

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of CASA_quant is to document the process of building large scale networks, routing and gravity modelling with R.
Some of the data necessary to run these scripts requires specific access authorizations that can be obtained by registering with an institution on the UKDataService website and then downloading the census flows at MSOA level from WICID. 

# Downloading networks

Up to a certain scale, like a big city, the regular packages handle the task pretty well. One like [__osmnx__](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx)[@boeing_osmnx_2017] in python for example proved good to download graph format data (edges and nodes separately with all the necessary data for each.)


# Routing

Routing is done with the [__cppRouting__](https://github.com/vlarmet/cppRouting) [@larmet_cppR_2022] package. For that, one needs to find the nearest node in the network to the centroid of the origin and destination geometries. In base R, this can be done with the `st_nearest_feature` function from __sf__ [@pebesma_simple_2018], which will work efficiently up to a certain number of locations. A medium city size network with around 200 origin/destination points seemed to be the limit on the machine on which it was run. 


# Gravtiy model

Done with the [__cppSim__](https://github.com/ischlo/cppSim) package, available from github. 
See example in the package description. 

# Local test

The scripts most suited for a local test are in the [small_area_run](https://github.com/ischlo/QUANT_at/tree/main/small_area_run) folder. A tutorial will be made to explain that in more details.
